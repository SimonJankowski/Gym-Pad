I will keep It as Development Story file

The motivation of building this project Is to practice Typescript(only started learning last week), Implement data visulasation for the first time, Implement Google login using modern syntax, Connect Database (Mongo Atlas or DynamoDB) with user data.

Ultimately It should be finished as full MERN application, and if i decide to develop further functions, i will refactor it to redux/redux form/react-form.

Stage 1: Skeleton
I decided to Begin with user-side routing with 3 routes (landing page/login page/ chart screen). I am considering adding /demo route after initial deployment. I am going to use Bootstrap 5 as i am really comfortable with it and it will speed up development.

Stage 2: User Authentication
Created new project at console.developers.google.com to obtain credentials, And integrated Login proccess using modern syntax (ES2017 Async await, and Hooks: useEffect, useRef, useState)

First time i noticed that typescript is more than just annoying when I forgot to return default from conditional statement inside renderAuthButton that should return JSXElement :)

Stage 3: back-end setup
Set up standart RESTful API with node.js+express, connected To MongoDB, created script to seed it, so far backend accepts get request on /user/:id, and responds with entire user object. Date data is stored as a number( generated by Date.now() )

stage 4: Chart Integration
Wrote multiple helper methods and loops to be able to modify Chart based of number of entries, scale of changes, and render dates on the chart in compant readable format
